      <h2>Some facts about Dr. Sanduk Ruit</h2>

      <p>Sanduk Ruit (Nepali: सन्दुक रूइत, pronounced [ˈsʌnduk rui̯t]) is an ophthalmologist (eye surgeon) from Nepal who has restored the sight of over 130,000 people across Africa and Asia using small-incision cataract surgery. He is also one of the founders of the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology.
      </p>   
      <p>For his work in taking quality, life-transforming cataract surgery to the poorest, he has been referred to as the "God of Sight".</p>  
      <p>In 1994, Ruit helped found the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology,which provides free treatment to those who cannot afford to pay. It manufactures high-quality intraocular lenses for surgery at a fraction of the price of its previous manufacturing cost. The extremely low cost of these lenses have made quality cataract surgeries affordable to the poorest population.</p>     
      <p>Ruit was awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for Peace and International Understanding, considered to be the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize, for "placing Nepal at the forefront of developing safe, effective, and economical procedures for cataract surgery, enabling the needlessly blind in even the poorest countries to see again."</p> 
      <p> In 2018, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri, its fourth highest civilian award, for “[his] innovation in the 1980s [that] led to a 90 percent reduction in the cost of cataract eye surgery, provides low-cost cataract surgery lenses to over thirty countries.”</p>
      <p>His biography The Barefoot Surgeon, authored by Australian writer Ali Gripper, was published in June 2018. This biography's Nepali translation version 'Sanduk Ruit' was published by Fine Print Books in 2019.</p>
